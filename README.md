</p>

> - ### Client
>   - The client represents a user of the chat application, it uses the ClientInfo interface to communicate with the server. The directory also contains the implementation of the graphical interface of the client application.

> - ### Server
>   - The server acts as an intermediary so that the clients can communicate with each other. It initializes the remote ChatService used by the client to communicate with the rest of the network.

> - ### Common
>   - Contains the Message class representing a network message and MyLogManager to display log messages.

> - ### Remote interfaces
>   - Represents and contains all used remote interfaces.


## Instructions

1. Compile the source code with the following command:
   
   ```console
      make clean
      make
   ```
   > Do not close this console because rmiregistry execution depends on it.

2. Open a new console and use the following command to launch the server:
   ```console
      make launch-server
   ```
3. Open a new console and use the following command to launch a client:
   ```console
      make launch-client
   ```
## Potential future improvements

- A private lounge system can be added by implementing a dynamic list of joinable lounges and the possibility to create new ones.
- A better password login system for greater reliability and security.
- A maximum number of users that can connect to the server to regulate the network load.
- A server side (UI) administration panel to manage the network.
